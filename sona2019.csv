"1582","While #loadshedding sabotages #SouthAfrica #economic revival &amp; all the #SONA2019 hype, its potential effect on the ANC's #election campaign might just be a wake-up call for action. Either way, #Ramaphosa needs to step up and take charge."

"1584","There's an urgency to this #SONA2019 not seen in recent times. There's also a fairly dramatic wish-and-promise list that will be closely monitored. #SouthAfrica"
"1585","Despite Ramaphosa's attempt at a  more rousing #SONA2019, the #SONADebate occurs within the context of all that #loadshedding stands for and therefore puts the #DA back on the offensive - a position they surely need to maintain to claw back support."
"1586","The 8th of May will test #Ramaphosa's support at the polls. On the basis of #SONA2019 tonight, Opposition parties should be concerned that his credible demeanour &amp; broad wish-list will appeal to many. Implementation though remains unknown."

"1588","The most-wide-ranging and expansive #SONA2019 in recent times as he seeks a mandate on 8th May yet he still seeks a leap-of-faith from the electorate over the ANC's dismal last decade. This is Cyril's election now."
"1589","#Ramaphosa steals the middle-ground - at least in rhetoric if not in substance in #SONA2019 but he still requires commitment from his own party in order to make his optimism a reality."
"1590","This was a manifesto-launch masquerading as a #SONA2019 but the door opened marginally on the disposal of non-performing SOE's. Very much baby-steps on ideological change but broad-brushstrokes designed for maximum electoral - and business - appeal. https://t.co/i0nVAHBOI5"
"1591","An exceptionally wide-ranging #SONA2019 that resembled more an election manifesto launch. But few will argue with the sentiments - just the ability to implement against a host of political challenges."
"1592","#SONA2019 is so wide-ranging and full of wish-lists, it more resembles an election manifesto. Oh yes, there is an election soon!"
"1593","#SONA2019 successfully launched Cyril Ramaphosa's election bid in the May 8 elections. That was its intention and it excelled at that. He wants votes first - but judgement on results will have to be deferred. #SouthAfrica"

"9460","SABC live broadcasts are always shit. 
#SONA2019"
"9461","Thabang Makwetla must stop clapping hands<U+0001F602>
#SONA2019"
"9462","Everyone is happy about the speech, the PAC is never happy about anything <U+0001F602>
#SONA2019"
"9463","Hopefully he'll appoint another Deputy President after the election. #SONA2019 https://t.co/T3LXRhHT6N"
"9464","So, some #SONA2019 thoughts.

Overall, a great speech, thick with both policy substance and an aspirational vision, though sometimes going too far in both directions. Ramaphosa has shown that he's a politician of a vastly higher calibre than most."
"9465","A long-term vision of development: Clear embrace of globalization, free trade and technology on the one hand and a social market economy on the other. In a political landscape riddled with proto-communists and out-of-touch classical liberals, this is sorely needed. #SONA2019"
"9466","Finally, a comparison with the ridiculous piece of theatre that was the US State of the Union on Tuesday is worthwile, and not just with regard to the absurd contrast between the presidents. The US could learn a lot from real democracies. (Though it won't, of course.) #SONA2019"
"9467","In contrast to the feting of Zuma in KZN before the manifesto launch, there were almost no concessions whatsoever to the RET wing of the ANC, or the EFF. Clear promise of consequences for corruption and state capture. The most encouraging part of the speech, IMO. #SONA2019"
"9468","And EFF Twitter has managed to twist this into a victory, despite Malema chickening out of disrupting, by making up the preposterous idea that the speech ""copied"" the EFF manifesto. One look at the two is enough to tell you how insane that is, but it'll catch on. #SONA2019"
"9469","No doubt we'll hear more of all that in the coming days, and Ramaphosa, too, will go back to his understandable but irritating ambiguity. But this was the odd political speech that actually had some value. #SONA2019"
"9470","Second, the people saying, variously, that this is all promises, and Ramaphosa hasn't done anything, which ignores how fundamentally different he is to much of the ANC leadership, and his achievements. The commissions may not be the most dramatic, but they are crucial. #SONA2019"
"9471","Proactive initiatives by Ramaphosa himself: Competition regulations, internships, partnerships with the private sector, investment, progress in education, ACFTA. Clear, quantifiable pledges with spans of a few years, all good idas. #SONA2019"
"9472","Oh, and I'm looking forward to Tucker Carlson taking Malema's response to the speech tomorrow and attributing it to Ramaphosa, prompting a 3AM Trump tweet. Maybe that'll illustrate to Lindiwe Sisulu the difference between what is démarche-worthy and what isn't. #SONA2019"
"9473","The same thing on the social front with regards to non-racialism, equality and multiculturalism, though with less time spent on it; I would have wished a clearer rebuke of Afriforum and the EFF. #SONA2019"
"9474","The reaction has been predictably obnoxious. First, every fourth person in the ANC caucus giving CR a standing ovation is planning to actively oppose him at every turn, from the lists to the 2019 NGC. Reference to Min. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma was galling as well. #SONA2019"
"9475","The speech has underscored, for me, the need for Ramaphosa to win a full term and cement his control over the ANC. If not obstructed by looters, economic illiterates and racial demagogues, this man could be one of the best heads of government in the world. #SONA2019"
"9476","Cleaning up Zuma and Malema's populist mess: NHI bill coming up in the foreseeable future, a few references to land expropriation. CR seems to be trying to lower the temperature until he can craft these in a responsible way, which is a good thing. #SONA2019"
"9477","Promises made, promises kept: SOE boards, NPA, law enforcement, investment numbers. A relatively small portion of the speech, but that makes sense given that CR has been in office for just a year and has to fight off the Zuma cabal at every turn. #SONA2019"
"9478","Mxm this party poopers whatsaping the #SONA2019 speech while we watching it live are boring.
